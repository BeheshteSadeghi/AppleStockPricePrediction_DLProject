### Apple Stock Price Prediction

This project aims to provide a deep learning model for predicting Apple stock price.
After EDA, two DL networks; LSTM and SimpleRNN are created and the prediction performance is compared.
For applying NN models, time-series data is adapted such that a memory-based algorithm like LSTM can be applied.
The result shows better performance of LSTM algorithm.
